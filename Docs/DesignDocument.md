# Design Document
## 1 Design Consideration
---
### 1.1 Assumptions
1.1 Assumptions
First, users understand our controls. Every user thinks differently, which is something we are considerd when coming up with our application design. We have to be sure to consider that when people try to accomplish a specific task without instruction, sometimes they just don't do what we'd expect. 

Second, users understand our symbols. Symbols are a great way to convey information visually. Where some designers run into trouble is assuming that symbols are universal. For example, if we were to see the sign while looking for a restroom, we would imagine the classic men and women character.

Third, users read instructions or help messages. we read an instruction manual before using a new gadget. Users may have problems using our application, so it is necessary to organize a message that helps with the instructions and help messages.

Lastly, users use our site under ideal conditions. Whether its having to turn down the backlight on a mobile device to conserbe power or using the device in direct sunlight, there are many different instances when users won't be viewing our application under ideal conditions. It is important to keep in mind that legibility is key. 

### 1.2 Constraints
Firstly we prioritize the function. It could be good for creating an attractive function to execute many features performance as possible. However, adding a lot of features does not mean we can deliver a successfully implementing or perform perfectly. This is because too many features can confuse users. In other words, it is important to be intuitive, optimized, and not complicated. Our apps focus only on a few key features.

### 1.3 System Environment
Android Capable Smartphones are well suited to handle an app such as this (GroceryList). We are targeting devices that support API level 15 and above.
## 2 Architectural Design

The architectual design consists of the component design and the deployment diagram. each diagram is designed and expalined below as the following
### 2.1 Component Diagram

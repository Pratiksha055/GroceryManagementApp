pros:

* we felt that the pros included a detailed design which met all of the requirements for the GroceryListManager.
* The design allowed for items to be selected and added to the GroceryList as well as unchecking all items.  
* It also allowed for creating and deleting multiple GroceryLists.

cons:

* Searching by type of item was not clear. 
* The user class was not really necessary as there is no need to track users for a grocery list (ie, no requirement for tracking user actually who buys an item or checks out an item)
* Design overly complex to implement, including some unnecessary classes

  pros:
  * The design met all of the requirements and seems easy to understand and implement.
  * The design allowed users to add items, delete items ,and change the quantity of items in the list.
  * The design allowed to create big list of Item objects so that user can choose items from this list and we use this list as menu. 
  
  cons:
  * lacks specifying an item by typing its name.

    This diagram is shown the required classes, their properties, and operators that are simply expressed according to the task description.
    However, It will require a lot of detail to be implemented as a real program.
    This diagram seems to be added more attributes in each class to handle further data.
    In implementing the program, it seems necessary to implement the relationship in more detail.

 pros:
  - The design is very clear for users and multiple functions is working to perform each task.
  - Fulfilling the desired tasks for the individual every category
  
 cons:
  - The UML is not very easy to code. A very complex grocery List manager.
  - Having to many functionalities and data increases a chance of error.

  pros:
  - The program is readable to any programmer that understand a small fraction of program.
  - Any program can run the program and change or reuse anytime they want easily. 
  - developing the program can be easily developed and organized since the classes ,attributes and operations are all classified. 
  - The UML design helps avoid a more extensive code that can take hours and with this UML the program can be made nicely with separate codes for each task to make the program easier to debug
  cons:
  - Although the UML design can avoid extensive and time consuming code, the UML design itself takes a long time to make. For the UML to be beneficial, a programmer needs to synchronize the codes that takes the software project's maintenance and time.
  - This UML lacks formal semantics in a few areas.
  - The UML is also quite complex because of how many classes and attributes it has which can make the programmer confused and making the design less helpful.

The design that we have chosen as our "team design" is somewhat similar to design 5 but design 5 lacks detail. In the team design each class and attribute is mentioned with its method as whereas design 5 doesn't. Design 5 is considered is very basic compared to what is described in the "team design". For the UML to be as effective as possible for the code, the designer must provide a lot more detail for the code to be more organized and less complex. 








c. All in all, with effective communication and team work we were able to come to an agreement of what design would work best. Some designs lack some detail or provided too much detail but with the design that we have chosen we believe that this design will help develop an effective "GroceryListManager" app that will fulfill Brad and Janets needs for grocery shopping.

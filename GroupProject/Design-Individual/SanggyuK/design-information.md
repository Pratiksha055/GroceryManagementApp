1. A grocery list consists of items the users want to buy at a grocery store. The application must allow users to add items to a list, delete items from a list, and change the quantity of items in the list (e.g... change from one to two pounds of apples).
To realize this requirement, I added to the design operation add item, delete item and change the quantity of item.

2. The application must contain a database (DB) of items and corresponding item types.
To realize this requirement, I added to the design classes item and type.

3. Users must be able to add items to a list by picking them from a hierarchical list, where the first level is the item type (e.g., cereal), and the second level is the name of the actual item (e.g., shredded wheat). After adding an item, users must be able to specify a quantity for the item.
The classes type and itme would be hierarchical relationship.

4. Users must also be able to specify an item by typing its name. In this case, the application must look in its DB for items with similar names and ask the users, for each of them, whether that is the item they intended to add. if a match cannot be found, the application must ask the user to select a type for the item and then save the new item, together with its type, in its DB.
I added to the operation to find item by input and list item in specific type. 

5. Lists must be saved automatically and immediately after they are modified.
Not considered because it does not affect the design directly.

6. Users must be able to check off items in a list(without deleting them).
I added an operator of check.

7. Users must also be able to clear all the check-off marks in a list at once.
I added an operator of check off every item at once. 

8. Check-off marks for a list are persistent and must also be saved immediately.
Not considered because it does not affect the design directly.

9. The application must present the items in a list grouped by type, so as to allow users to shop for a specific type of product at once (i.e., without having to go back and forth between aisles).
I added an operator of show items in same type. 

10. The application must support multiple lists at a time ( e.g., "weekly grocery list",  "monthly farmer's market list"). Therefore, the application must provide the users with the ability to create, (re)name, select, and delete lists.
I added object attributes list of item in User class and operators to create, rename, select, and delete lists

11. The User Interface (UI) must be intuitive and responsive. 
Not considered because it does not affect the design directly.
